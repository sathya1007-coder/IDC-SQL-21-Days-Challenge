/* Daily Challenge: Create a trend analysis showing for each service and week: week number, patients_admitted, running total of patients admitted (cumulative), 3-week moving 
average of patient satisfaction (current week and 2 prior weeks), and the difference between current week admissions and the service average. Filter for weeks 10-20 only.*/
